            This was my final project for Harvard's PS70 Intro to Digital
            Fabrication class. The process is (will be) documented more on my
            website for that class, but to give a summary: I wanted to create
            some sort of display that would show the real time locations of the
            MBTA trains. Originally, I was going to go with simple LEDs, but I
            was challenged to make the display mechanical :)
          </div>
          <div class="body-text">
            The train location data is pulled from the MBTA's API, and the
            trains are displayed on a laser-cut map of Boston/Cambridge. As you
            can see, I actually narrowed the scope down to just a few stops on
            the Red Line (Davis, Porter, Harvard, MIT). I felt I was pressed for
            time, but it ended up working really well, so I probably could've
            committed to the whole line or including other lines. Underneath the
            map, a gantry system moves an electromagnet that powers on and off
            to slide the trains to their location the map. I figured this was
            the easiest and most cost-efficient way to move the trains around,
            since the T isn't exactly known for its speed.
          </div>
          <div class="body-text">
            I programmed it using an ESP32, driving the gantry system with timer
            pulley belts and stepper motors + drivers. Calibration was done with
            limit switchesThe little train icons are 3d-printed, and they have a
            magnet press-fit into them. Overall, a super fun project, got to use
            plenty of the tools I learned throughout the semester (laser cutter,
            3d printer, band saw, etc.). I really want to iterate over this
            project in the future, creating a smaller, cheaper display that
            actually includes the rest of the map. Maybe I could hang it up or
            display it in my apartment. From there, maybe I'd look at adding the
            commuter rail network or buses.
